# LinioTest

Challenge - Backend Developer
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for
multiples of 3, instead of the number, print "Linio". For multiples of 5 print
"IT". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Linianos".

But here's the catch: you can use only one 'if'. No multiple branches, ternary
operators or 'else'.

# Requirements
* 1 if
* You can't use 'else', 'else if' or ternary
* Unit tests
* You can write the challenge in any language you want. Here at Linio we are
big fans of PHP, Kotlin and TypeScript
